# GnosisPages
GnosisPages is a tool that helps you to create your own knowledge base for retrieval information when interacting with a LLM. The app take advantage of the frameworks Streamlit and Langchain and uses a client-side ChromaDB.

## Features

GnosisPages offers you the following key features:

- **Upload PDF files**: Upload PDF files until 200MB size. PDF files should be programmatically created or processed by an OCR tool.
- **Extract and split text**: Extract the content of your PDF files and split them for a better querying.
- **Store in a client-side VectorDB**: GnosisPages uses ChromaDB for storing the content of your pdf files on vectors (ChromaDB use by default "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" for embeddings)
- **Consult the info of your knowledge base**: Ask questions to the Intelligent Assitant about the content of your knowledge base. The Langchain Agent will use ChromaDB query functions as a tool.
